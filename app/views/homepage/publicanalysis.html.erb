<h1>The CACHE Savings Plan</h1>
<h2>Save and spend your way to a brighter future</h2>
<body>
Our savings plan is simple! You're free to add and withdraw money from your account at any time. Every month we reward you $1 for every $100 in average daily balances! 75% of the award can be used for spending any way you like at our consumer partners, and 25% of the award is cash that you're free to spend any way you like, although we'd recommend you save it!
<br><br>
The following table illustrates how much you can save and earn in Cache awards and cash back, based on estimated monthly salaries and assuming you save 20% of your annual salary.

Let's say you make $2,500 a month when you start contributing to the Cache Savings Plan and that you save 20% of your annual salary, or about $6,000 per year.
<br><br>
Assume that during your career your salary grows 10% per year on average, and that you save just a little more every year, let's say 10% more than before.
<br><br>
Even using these conservative estimates, you can achieve your financial goals!

  Ever dreamed of owning a car... the down-payment on a first car in Singapore is $20,000. You could buy a car after just 3 years! Although we'd recommend you skip the car and take the MRT or an UBER! All Cache account holders get additional discounts on UBER!
  <br><br>
  Getting married is expensive! Assuming you spend $25,000 on your wedding, you could have enough saved in just over 3 years! And our savings partners will help you save even more with discounted catering, apparel, jewelry and hotels!
  <br><br>
  What about the big expenses? Do you dream of buying a house or sending your kids to a fancy college abroad? Well, in as little as 10 years you could save enough for that!
